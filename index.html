		<strong>Relations:</strong><br>	
		
		<i>In the following, substitute actual names for Relation1, Relation2 etc. Have as many entries as the number of relations in your project. Clicking a link on a relation name should execute an SQL query and list *all* the tuples in that particular relation (of course, the links below don't work). Your output should be presented on a separate web page in a neat, orderly fashion, one row for each tuple and columns plainly evident. Ensure that all columns have their headers listed and their data types are clear (i.e., state which is an int and which is a char and so on).</i>

		<strong>Queries:</strong><br>
		
		<i>In the following, add an English query description for each of the five queries that you created for Part 6 of your project. Again, clicking a link on the query name should execute the appropriate SQL query and list the tuples that are the answer to that particular query. Again, make sure your output is neatly ordered and column names and data types are evident. The output of the query should appear on a separate page. Near the top of the page, above the tidily presented query output, must be the original SQL for your query.</i>

		<strong>Ad-hoc Query:</strong><br>
		
		<i>Provide a free-form box and two buttons called "Submit" and "Clear" here. The intent is that the user can enter any arbitrary SQL query in the box and click the submit button. The action should be that you should execute that query on the database and bring up the answers on a separate page, once again, in a neat, orderly fashion. Notice that the input can be any legal SQL query (permissible under your DB system, of course).

The grader will use table names from your own documentation (Project Part 3, etc), so do not change the names of your tables unless you update all of your documentation to match the new names.</i>
